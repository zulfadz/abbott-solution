### [1.2.10](#toc) 

Decide which of the following are true statements. Provide a short justification for those that are valid and a counterexample for those that are not:

   1. Two real numbers satisfy $a<b$ if and only if $a<b+\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon>0$.
   2. Two real numbers satisfy $a<b$ if $a<b+\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon>0$.
   3. Two real numbers satisfy $a \leq b$ if and only if $a<b+\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon>0$.
  
---

1. False. Let $a=b$. In this case, although $a<b+ \epsilon$ for each $\epsilon>0$, $a$ is not smaller than $b$. (Note that for the other way around, it is true: if $a<b$, then $a<b+\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon>0$. Assume there is some $\epsilon$ such that $a \geq b+ \epsilon$. Then $a-b \geq \epsilon >0$, which means $a>b$, which is a contradiction).
2. False, as above.
3. First, show that if $a \leq b$, then $a < b + \epsilon$ for each $\epsilon >0$. This has already been shown in 1. Second, show that if $a<b+\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon>0$, then $a \leq b$. Assume that $a > b$. Take $\epsilon_0 = a-b$. This means that $a<b + \epsilon_0 = b + a -b = a$, which is a contradiction.

### [1.2.11](#toc) 

Form the logical negation of each claim. One trivial way to do this is to simply add "It is not the case that..." in front of each assertion. To make this interesting, fashion the negation into a positive statement that avoids using the word "not" altogether. In each case, make an intuitive guess as to whether the claim or its negation is the true statement.

  1. For all real numbers satisfying $a<b$, there exists an $n \in \mathbf{N}$ such that $a+1 / n<b$.
  2. There exists a real number $x>0$ such that $x<1 / n$ for all $n \in \mathbf{N}$.
  3. Between every two distinct real numbers there is a rational number.
  
---

1. There exist some real numbers $a<b$ such that for all $n \in \mathbf{N}$, $a+ 1/n >b$. I think the claim is the true statement, and the negation is false.
2. For all real number $x>0$, $x \geq 1/n$ for some $n \in \mathbf{N}$. The negation is true.
3. There exist two distinct real numbers between which there is no rational number. I think the claim is true, and the negation is false.

### [1.2.12](#toc) 

 Let $y_{1}=6$, and for each $n \in \mathbf{N}$ define $y_{n+1}=\left(2 y_{n}-6\right) / 3$

1. Use induction to prove that the sequence satisfies $y_{n}>-6$ for all $n \in \mathbf{N}$.
2. Use another induction argument to show the sequence $\left(y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}, \ldots\right)$ is decreasing.
  
---

1. The statement is obviously true when $n=1$. Assume $y_{n}>-6$ is true, and we need to show that this is true for $y_{n+1}$ as well.

$$\begin{align*}
y_{n+1}&= (2 y_{n}-6)/3  \\
 &> (2(-6) -6 )/3   \\
& > (-12 -6)/3 \\
&> -6
\end{align*}$$

2. Since $y_2 = (2(6)-6)/3=2$, $y_1 > y_2$. Assume $y_{n-1} > y_{n}$, and we need to show that $y_{n} > y_{n+1}$.

Answer 1:

$$\begin{align*}
 y_{n+1} &= 2y_{n}/3 -2 \\
 &<0.8y_n -2 \\
 &<0.8y_n \\
 &<y_n
 \end{align*}$$

 Answer 2: Simply multiply 2 across the inequality, minus 6, and divide 3, to get
 $$\begin{align*}
 \left(2 y_{n-1}-6\right) / 3 &> \left(2 y_{n}-6\right) / 3 \\
 y_{n}&>y_{n+1}
 \end{align*}$$

### [1.2.13](#toc) 

For this exercise, assume Exercise 1.2.5 has been successfully completed.
  1. Show how induction can be used to conclude that $$ (A_1 \cup A_{2}\cup \cdots \cup A_{n})^{c}=A_{1}^{c} \cap A_{2}^{c} \cap \cdots \cap A_{n}^{c}$$ for any finite $n \in \mathbf{N}$. 
 
  2. It is tempting to appeal to induction to conclude $$\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i}\right)^{c}=\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i}^{c}$$  but induction does not apply here. Induction is used to prove that a particular statement holds for every value of $n \in \mathbf{N}$, but this does not imply the validity of the infinite case. To illustrate this point, find an example of a collection of sets $B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, \ldots$ where $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} B_{i} \neq \emptyset$ is true for every $n \in \mathbf{N}$, but $\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} B_{i} \neq \emptyset$ fails.
   
  3. Nevertheless, the infinite version of De Morgan's Law stated in (b) is a valid statement. Provide a proof that does not use induction.
  
---

1. From Exercise 1.2.5, we know that the base case $$(A_1 \cup A_2)^c = A_1^c \cap A_2^c$$ holds. Assume that $$(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n)^c = A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap \cdots \cap A_n^c$$ <span style="color:red">Thinking the solution to this is taking longer than expected, so refer to online solutions. By associative laws, $$(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n \cup A_{n+1})^c = ((A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n) \cup A_{n+1})^c $$ which by Exercise 1.2.5. implies $$(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n)^c \cap A_{n+1}^c $$ From assumption, this is equal to $$ A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap \cdots \cap A_n^c \cap A_{n+1}^c$$</span>

2. Let 

$$\begin{align*}
B_1 &= \mathbf{N} = \{1,2,3, \cdots\} \\
B_2 &= \{2,3,4,\cdots\} \\
B_3 &= \{3,4,5,\cdots\}
\end{align*}$$ 
We see that $$B_1 \cap B_2 = B2$$ and we will prove using induction that $$ \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} B_{i}=B_n$$ Assume the above is true for $n$. In the case of $n+1$, by associative law, $$B_1 \cap B_2 \cap  \cdots B_n \cap B_{n+1} =  (B_1 \cap B_2 \cap  \cdots B_n) \cap B_{n+1}$$ which means $$B_n \cap B_{n+1} $$ which is equal to $B_{n+1}$. Therefore $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} B_{i}=B_n$ holds for all $n \in \mathbf{N}$.

Nonetheless, this does not hold for infinite case, because $$ \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} B_{i}=\emptyset$$ To see why, suppose there is $x \in \mathbf{N}$ which satisfies $x \in \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} B_{i}$. This means that $x$ is an element of $B_i$ for all $i \in \mathbf{N}$. However, this is a contradiction because $x$ is not an element of $B_{x+1}$.

3. Let 

$$x \in \left(\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)^c$$

meaning 

$$x \notin \left(\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)$$ 

implying that $x$ is not an element of $A_i$ for all $i$.<span style="color:red">Alternatively $x\in A_i^c$ for all $i$.</span> This means that $x \in \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i^c$ which implies 

$$\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)^c \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i^c.$$ 

Conversely, let 

$$x \in \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i^c $$ 

which means that $x \in A_i^c$ for all $i$, which is the same as $x\notin A_i$ for all $i$. This implies that $x \notin \bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i$, meaning $x \in \left(\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)^c.$ This implies 

$$\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i^c \subseteq \left(\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)^c  .$$

### [1.3.1](#toc) 

1. Write a formal definition in the style of Definition 1.3.2 for the infimum or greatest lower bound of a set.
2. Now, state and prove a version of lemma 1.3.8 for glb.

---

1. A real number $g$ is the greatest lower bound for a set $A \subseteq \mathbf{R}$ if it meets the following two criteria:
    * $g$ is a lower bound for $A$.
    * if $b$ is any lower bound for $A$, then $g \geq b$. 

2. Lemma. Assume $g \in \mathbf{R}$ is a lower bound for a set $A \subseteq \mathbf{R}$. Then $g = \text{inf }A$ if and only if for every choice $\epsilon >0$, there exists an element $a \in A$ satisfying $g + \epsilon > a.$
    * Assume $g = \text{inf } A$. Then $g \leq a$ for all $a$. Because $g$ is the greatest lower bound, $g + \epsilon$ cannot be $\leq a$ for all $a$. Otherwise, this will contradict statement ii of definition of $g$. Thus, there exists some $a$ such that $g + \epsilon > a.$
    * Assume $g \leq a$ for all $a$, and that for all $\epsilon >0$, $g + \epsilon > a$ for some $a$. If $b$ is a lower bound of $A$, and it is greater than $g$, let $\epsilon_0 = b-g$. Meaning $b = g + \epsilon_0 > a$, thus this is not possible. Therefore $g \geq b$.

<a name="132"></a>

### [1.3.2](#toc) 

Give an example of each of the following, or state that the request is impossible.
1. A set $B$ with $\text{inf }B \geq \text{sup }B$.
2. A finite set that contains its infimum but not its supremum.
3. A bounded subset of $\mathbf{Q}$ that contains its supremum but not its infimum.

---

1. $B = \{1\}$.
2. Not possible
3. $\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \cdots \}$.

<a name="133"></a>

### [1.3.3](#toc) 

1. Let $A$ be nonempty and bounded below, and define $B = \{b\in \mathbf{R}: b \text{ is a lower bound for }A \}$. Show that $\text{sup }B = \text{inf }A$.
2. Use the above to explain why there is no need to assert that greatest lower bounds exist as part of the Axiom of Completeness.

---

1. 

$\rightarrow$ Let $s= \text{sup }B$, and $g= \text{inf }A$. First we show that $s \leq g$. Suppose $s > g$. Meaning by Lemma 1.3.8 and taking $\epsilon_0 = s-g$, $g = s - \epsilon_0 < b$ for some $b$. By definition, $b < a$ for all $a$, and we just show that $b$ is bigger than $g$. But this is a contradiction of statement (ii) of definition 1.3.2. 

$\leftarrow$ Next we show that $s \geq g$. Suppose $s <g$. Then $s <(s+g)/2 < g$, which means that $(s+g)/2$ is a lower bound of A. Which means $(s+g)/2 \in \mathbf{B}$. However, this is a contradiction because $s$ by definition is greater than or equal to all $b \in \mathbf{B}$.

<span style="color:red">Alternative, better answer: Because $A$ is bounded below, $B$ is not empty. Moreover, $B$ is bounded above by $A$. By Axiom of Completion, we can say that $s = \text{sup }B$ exists. Now we need to show that $s = \text{inf }A$, by proving that $s$ is a lower bound of A, and if any $k$ is a lower bound $A$, $k \leq s$.</span>  

<span style="color:red">On the first part, since $A$ is an upper bound of $B$, by statement (ii) of definition 1.3.2, $s \leq a$ for all $a \in A$. Therefore $s$ is a lower bound of A.</span> 


<span style="color:red">Secondly, if any $k$ is a lower bound of $A$, then $k \in B$. By statement (i) of definition 1.3.2, $k \leq s$.</span> 



2. The axiom states that every nonempty set, bounded above has a least upper bound. The above shows the least upper bound is simply the greatest lower bounds of the set of all upper bound the the earlier set.

<span style="color:red">Better answer: By proving that the infimum of A is equal to the supremum of another set, we use that the existence of least upper bounds to assert the existence of greatest lower bound.</span> 

<a name="134"></a>

### [1.3.4](#toc) 

Let $A_1, A_2, A_3, \cdots$ be a collection of nonempty sets, each of which is bounded above.

1. Find a formula for sup ($A_1 \cup A_2$). Extend this to sup ($\cup_{k=1}^{n} A_k$).
2. Consider sup($\cup_{k=1}^{\infty} A_k$). Does the formula in (a) extend to the infinite case?

---

1. Straight-up intuition: max {sup $A_1$, sup $A_2$, ... $A_n$}.

Proof: Let A = $\cup_{k=1}^{n} A_k$. Let M = max {sup $A_1$, sup $A_2$, ..., $A_n$}. We have 

$$ \forall x \in A, x \leq M$$


Let $\epsilon > 0$. Suppose M = sup $A_1$

then $$ \exists a \in A_1 : M - \epsilon < a \leq M $$

$$ \implies \exists a \in A : M - \epsilon < a \leq M $$

The proof follows from lemma 1.3.8.

<span style="color:red">Better answer: Let $m_k$ = sup $A_k$. Let M = sup {$m_1$, $m_2$, ..., $m_n$}. Let $a \in \cup_{k=1}^{n} A_k$. Then $a \in A_k$ for some k. Thus $ a \leq m_k \leq M$. Therefore M is an upper bound of $\cup_{k=1}^{n} A_k$. If b is another upper bound of $\cup_{k=1}^{n} A_k$, then it is also an upper bound of each $A_k$. By statement ii of definition 1.3.2, this means $s_k \leq b$ for each k. By statement ii of definition 1.3.2, this again means that $s \leq b$. </span> 

2. Yes, i think. 


<a name="135"></a>

### [1.3.5](#toc) 

Let A $\subseteq \mathbf{R}$ be nonempty and bounded above and let c be a real number. Define the set cA = {ca : a $\in$ A}.

1. If $c \geq 0$, show that sup(cA) = csup(A).
2. Postulate a similar type of statement for the case c<0.

---

1. Let s = sup A. Then for all a $\in$ A, a $\leq s$. Multiplying c on both sides show that cs is an upper bound of cA. Let b be another upper bound of cA; i.e., $ca \leq b$ for all a. This is equivalent to $a \leq b/c$ if c is not zero. Because s is least upper bound of $a$, $s \leq b/c \implies sc \leq b.$ This proves cs is the least upper bound of cA. If c =0, then sup (cA) = sup (0.A) = 0 = 0. sup(A) = c.sup(A).

2. If $c < 0$, sup(cA) = c inf(A). 

Let s = inf A. Then for all a $\in$ A, a $\geq s$. Multiplying c on both sides show that cs is an upper bound of cA. If b is another upper bound of cA; i.e., $ca \leq b$ for all a. This is equivalent to $a \geq b/c$. Because s is greatest lower bound of $a$, $s \geq b/c \implies sc \leq b.$ This proves cs is the least upper bound of cA.

<a name="136"></a>

### [1.3.6](#toc) 

Given sets $A$ and $B$, define A+B = {a +b : a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B}. Follow these steps to prove that if A and B are nonempty and bounded above, then sup(A+B)=sup A + sup B.

1. Let s = sup A and t = sup B. Show s + t is an upper bound for A + B.
2. Now let $u$ be an arbitrary upper bound for $A+B$, and temporarily fix $a \in A$. Show $t \leq u -a$.
3. Finally show sup $(A+B) = s+t$.
4. Construct another proof of the same fact using lemma 1.3.8.


---

1. For any a $\in$ A, $a \leq s$, and for any b $\in$ B, $b \leq t$. 

Therefore $a + b \leq s + t$.


2. For any a $\in$ A, and any b $\in$ B, $a + b \leq u$. 

$$ \implies b \leq u -a $$

By definition ii of 1.3.2, this means $t \leq u -a$.

From 1, we have shown that s+t is an upper bound of A + B. 

Let $u$ = sup (A+B). From definitin 1 of 1.3.2, $u \leq s+t$.

From 2, we shown that $t + a \leq u$. 

Similarly, $s + b \leq u$.

Adding this up,we will get $s+t+a+b \leq 2u \implies a+b \leq 2u - s -t.$

From definition 1 of 1.3.2, $u \leq 2u - s -t \implies s + t \leq u$.

4. Using lemma 1.3.8, sup (A+B) = sup A + sup B $\iff$ for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exist $a+b$ such that sup A + sup B - $\epsilon$ < a+b.

Take any $\epsilon > 0$, and consider sup A + sup B - $\epsilon$

$\implies$ (sup A - $\epsilon$/2) + (sup B - $\epsilon$/2)

$\implies$ (sup A - $\epsilon$/2) < a and (sup B - $\epsilon$/2) < b

Adding these inequalities completes the proof.

<a name="137"></a>

### [1.3.7](#toc) 

Prove that if $a$ is an upper bound for $A$, and if $a$ is also an element of $A$, then it must be that $a = \text{sup }A$.

---

$a$ is an upper bound.

Suppose $b$ is another upper bound and $b <a$. But this is a contradiction since $a \in A$. Therefore either $b$ is not an upper bound, or $b \leq a$.

<span style="color:red">Easier: Suppose $b$ is another upper bound of $A$. By definition $b \geq a$ since $a$ is an element of $A$. </span> 

<a name="138"></a>

### [1.3.8](#toc) 

Compute without proofs the suprema and infima (if they exist) of the following sets:

1. $\{m/n: m,n \in \mathbf{N} \text{ with } m<n\}$
2. $\{(-1)^m/n: m,n \in \mathbf{N}\}$
3. $\{n/(3n+1): n \in \mathbf{N}\}$
4. $\{m/(m+n): m , n \in \mathbf{N}\}$

---

1. Supremum don't exist. Infimum is 0

<span style="color:red">Missed $m<n$. Thus supremum is 1. </span> 

2. Supremum is $1$. Infimum is $1$.

This is equal to 1/((3+1/n). Supremum is 1/3. Infimum is 1/4

3. This is equal to 1/(1 + n/m). Supremum is 1. Infimum is 0.

<a name="139"></a> 
   
### [1.3.9](#toc) 

1. If sup A < sup B, show that there exists an element $b\in B$ that is an upper bound for A.

2. Given an example to show that this is not always the case if we only assume sup A $\leq$ sup B.

---

1. Let $\epsilon$ be such that sup $A =$ sup $B - \epsilon$. By Lemma 1.3.8, there exists $b \geq$ sup $A \geq a$ for all $a$.

2. Consider $A = [0,1]$ and $B= (0,1)$. sup B $\geq$ sup A.  But there is no element in $B$ whereby it is an upper bound of A.

<a name="1310"></a>

### [Exercise 1.3.10 (Cut property)](#toc) 

If $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, disjoint sets with $A \cup B = \mathbf{R}$ and $a < b$ for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, then there exists $c \in R$ such that $x \leq c$ whenever $x \in A$ and $x \geq c$ whenever $x \in B$.

1. Use the Axiom of Completeness to prove the Cut Property.
2. Show that the implication goes the other way; that is, assume $\mathbf{R}$ possesses the Cut Property and let $E$ be a nonempty set that is bounded above. Prove sup E exists.
3. Give a concrete example showing that the Cut Property is not a valid statement when $\mathbf{R}$ is replace by $\mathbf{Q}$.


---

1. Since $A$ is nonempty and bounded above, by the Axiom, it has a least upper bound $s_1$. Thus, when $x \in A$, $x \leq s_1$.

By definition of supremum, all upper bounds of $A$ is greater or equal to $s$. In other words, for all $x \in B$, $x \geq s$.
 
2. Let $B$ be the set of all the upper bound of $E$. Let $B^c = \mathbf{R} - B$. Suppose $E$ does not have a least upper bound.

$\implies$ $E$ is disjointed from $B$, i.e., $E \cap B = \emptyset$ because otherwise there exist sup E.

$\implies$ $E \subseteq B^c$. Therefore, by the Cut Property, there exists $c$ such that $x \leq c$ whenever $x \in E$, and $x \geq c$ whenever $x \in B$.

$\implies$ $c$ cannot be in $E$ since $E$ does not have supremum. Therefore, $c$ is in $B$. But this also is not possible because otherwise it means that $c$ is the smallest upper bound of $E$ -- a contradiction.

3. $\{x: x^2 < 2, x \in \mathbf{Q} \}$ and $\{x: x^2 > 2, x \in \mathbf{Q} \}$.

### [Exercise 1.3.11](#toc)  

Decide if the following statements about suprema and infima are true or false. Give a short proof for those that are true. For any that are false, supply an example where the claim in question does not hold.

1. If $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, bounded and satisfy $A \subseteq B$, then sup $A \leq$ sup $B$
2. If sup $A <$ inf $B$ for sets $A$ and $B$,  then there exists $c \in \mathbf{R}$ satisfying $a < c <b$ for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
3. If there exists $c \in \mathbf{R}$ satisfying $a<c<b$ for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, then sup $A <$ inf $B$.

---

1. True. Suppose sup $A >$ sup $B$. 


$\implies$ Take $\epsilon = (\text{sup }A - \text{sup }B)/2$

$\implies$ $a_0 \geq \text{sup }A - \epsilon$, for some $a_0 \in A$ from Lemma 1.3.8. Moreover, sup $A - \epsilon > \text{sup } B \geq b$, for all $b \in B$.

$\implies$ $a \notin B$, which is a contradiction.


<span style="color:red">Easier: $a \leq$ sup $A$, and $a \leq$ sup $B$,  since all $a$ is in $B$. By definition of sup $A$, sup $A$ $\leq$ sup $B$. </span> 

2. Yes. Just find the average of sup $A$ and inf $B$. This number is bigger than the former, but smaller than the latter. By definition of sup and inf, the proof is completed.

3. $A = (0,1)$ and $B = (1,2)$. Taking $c=1$, all $a$ is less than $c$, which is less than all $b$. But $c=$ sup $A =$ inf $B$.

### [Exercise 1.4.1](#toc) 

Recall that $\mathbf{I}$ stands for the set of irrational numbers.
  
  1. Show that if $a, b \in \mathbf{Q}$, then $a b$ and $a+b$ are elements of $\mathbf{Q}$ as well.
  2. Show that if $a \in \mathbf{Q}$ and $t \in \mathbf{I}$, then $a+t \in \mathbf{I}$ and $a t \in \mathbf{I}$ as long as $a \neq 0$.
  3. Part (a) can be summarized by saying that $\mathbf{Q}$ is closed under addition and multiplication. Is $\mathbf{I}$ closed under addition and multiplication? Given two irrational numbers $s$ and $t$, what can we say about $s+t$ and $s t$?
  
---

1. Let $a = m/n$ and $b=k/l$, where $m,n$ are integers, and $k,l$ are non-zero integers. $$ab = mk/nl$$ is in $\mathbf{Q}$ because $mk$ is integer given that integer is closed under multiplication. Similarly, $nk$ is integer and nonzero. $$a+b = m/n + k/l= (ml + nk)/(nk)$$ $ml + nk$ is integer, while $nk$ is nonzero integer.

2. Suppose $a + t \in \mathbf{Q}$.
 Then adding this by $-a$ means that $t \in \mathbf{Q}$ by part 1, which is a contradiction. Similarly, suppose $at \in \mathbf{Q}$, then multiplying this by $1/a$ means that $t \in \mathbf{Q}$ by part 1, which is a contradiction.

 3. $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}$ is $2$, so $\mathbf{I}$ is not closed under multiplication. Meanwhile take $s = -t$, then $t+s$ = 0, which is rational. So it is not closed under addition.

 Let $A \subseteq \mathbf{R}$ be nonempty and bounded above, and let $s \in \mathbf{R}$ have the property that for all $n \in \mathbf{N}, s+\frac{1}{n}$ is an upper bound for $A$ and $s-\frac{1}{n}$ is not an upper bound for $A$. Show $s=\sup A$.

Given arbitrary $\epsilon >0$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $1/n < \epsilon$ by Archimedean Property. Thus $s - \epsilon<s- 1/n< a$ for some $a \in \mathbf{A}$, where the second equality is given. We are done by Lemma 1.3.8.

### [Exercise 1.4.4](#toc) 

Let $a<b$ be real numbers and consider the set $T=\mathbf{Q} \cap[a, b]$. Show $\sup T=b$

---

$T$ is not empty because by density of $\mathbf{Q}$ in $\mathbf{R}$, there is a rational number between $a$ and $b$. It is also bounded above, thus sup $T$ exists. 

1. Suppose sup $T$ $<$ $b$. Then, there exists rational number $r$ in between, which is larger than sup $T$. Contradiction.
2. Suppose sup $T > b$. Then there exists rational number $r$ in between, whereby $r$ is smaller than sup $T$ but is an upper bound of $T$. Contradiction.

Thus sup $T = b$.

### [Exercise 1.4.6](#toc) 

  Recall that a set $B$ is dense in $\mathbf{R}$ if an element of $B$ can be found between any two real numbers $a<b$. Which of the following sets are dense in $\mathbf{R}$ ? Take $p \in \mathbf{Z}$ and $q \in \mathbf{N}$ in every case.

 2. The set of all rational numbers $p / q$ with $q$ a power of 2 .
 
 3. The set of all rational numbers $p / q$ with $10|p| \geq q$.

 1. No. The minimum positive is $1/10$. The set cannot be found between $1/11$ and $1/12$.

 2. <span style="color:red">Yes. The idea is that you can find $1/2^{n}$ so small, such that given $(a,b)$, you can start from origin, and move in step size of $1/2^{n}$ towards $(a,b)$, and eventually falling in between $a$ and $b$.</span>

### [Exercise 1.4.7](#toc) 

  Finish the proof of Theorem 1.4.5 by showing that the assumption $\alpha^{2}>2$ leads to a contradiction of the fact that $\alpha=\sup T$.

  ---

Suppose $\alpha^2 >2$. Then

$$\begin{align*}
(a- 1/n)^{2} &= \alpha^2 - 2\alpha/n + 1/n^2 \\
&> \alpha^2 - 2\alpha/n.
\end{align*}$$


Find $n$ large enough such that $1/n <(\alpha^2 -2)2\alpha$, and such an $n$ exists from Archimedean property. This implies $2\alpha/n <(\alpha^2 -2)$, therefore

$$ (a- 1/n)^{2}> \alpha^2 - 2\alpha/n > \alpha^2 - (\alpha^2-2) = 2.$$

Thus $\alpha - 1/n$ is an upper bound of  $T$, which contradicts the fact that $a$ is the least upper bound.

  4. Impossible. Let $J_n = (I_1 \cap \cdots \cap 1_n)$.

      + $J_n$ is nonempty since   $\bigcap_{n=1}^{N} I_{n} \neq \emptyset$ 
      + $J_n$ is closed interval, since intersection of closed intervals is closed.

### [Exercise 1.5.1](#toc) 

Finish the following proof for Theorem 1.5.7

*Theorem 1.5.7* If $A \subseteq B$ and $B$ is countable, then $A$ is either countable or finite.

Assume $B$ is a countable set. Thus, there exists $f: \mathbf{N} \rightarrow B$, which is 1-1 and onto. Let $A \subseteq B$ be an infinite subset of $B$. We must show that $A$ is countable.

Let $n_1 = \text{min}\{n \in \mathbf{N}: f(n) \in A\}$. As a start to a definition of $g: \mathbf{N} \rightarrow A$, set $g(1) =f(n_{1})$. Show how to inductively continue this process to produce a 1-1 function $g$ from $\mathbf{N}$ onto $A$.

---

<span style="color:red">Took me too long to articulate this question, I ended up just looking for help online. Also how does the assumption that $A$ is infinite help in the proof? It helps because it narrows down the search of function to $f: \mathbf{N} \rightarrow B$.</span> 

Define $g(2) = f(n_{2})$ where $n_2 = \text{min}\{n \in \mathbf{N}: f(n) \in A/f(n_{1})\}$. 

More generally, for $x<y$, we have defined $g(x)$, and set $g(y)= f(n_{y})$ where $n_y = \text{min}\{n \in \mathbf{N}: f(n) \in A/ \{f(n_{1}), f(n_2), \cdots, f(n_{y-1})\}$.

The function is onto:

1. For any $s \in A$, there exists some $n* \in \mathbf{N}$ such that $f(n*) = s$ (since $f$ is onto).
2.  Therefore $n* \in \{n \in \mathbf{N}: f(n)\in A\}$.
3. After iteratively removing minimal element by $w-1 \in \mathbf{N}$ steps, $n*$ will be the minimal element. Hence, $g(w) = f(n*) =s$.

The function is 1-1:

1. For $x \neq y$, $g(x)$ corresponds to $f(n_{x})$ while $g(y)$ corresponds to $f(n_y)$.
2. $n_x \neq n_y$ (because they correspond to unique minimal elements, by construction of $g$).
3. $f(n_x) \neq f(n_y)$ (because $f$ is 1-1).

Note to myself: the construction of $g$, by iteratively removing minimal element is crucial because it helps to prove 1-1. The assumption that $f$ is 1-1 and onto also is crucial to prove the same for $g$.

### [Exercise 1.5.2](#toc) 

Review the proof of Theorem 1.5.6, part (ii) showing that $\mathbf{R}$ is uncountable, and then find the flaw in the following erroneous proof that $\mathbf{Q}$ is uncountable.

Assume for contradiction, that $\mathbf{Q}$ is countable. Thus we can write $\mathbf{Q} = \{r_1,r_2,...\}$ and, as before, construct a nested sequence of closed intervals with $r_n \notin I_n$. Our construction implies $\bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1}I_n = \emptyset$ while NIP implies $\bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} I_{n} \neq \emptyset$. This contradiction implies $\mathbf{Q}$ must therefore be uncountable.

---

It doesn't work because NIP doesn't hold for $\mathbf{Q}$. Namely, the intersection need not have any rational numbers. For example, take the nested, closed intervals around $\pi$, $[3,4],[3.1,3.2],[3.12,3.13],...$, then the infinite intersection is nonempty but the only element it includes is [not rational](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1914901/false-proofs-claiming-that-mathbbq-is-uncountable).

_Extra_: Why doesn't the above work for integers? Since a bounded interval in $\mathbf{Z}$ has finite elements, the nested interval $I_n$ will be exhausted after finitely many steps. Thus, the construction [doesn't work](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2373901/is-abbotts-proof-of-the-uncountabilty-of-real-numbers-too-strong).


 Because if we have closed nested intervals $I_n \supset I_{n+1}$, and $I_i \neq \emptyset$, then there exists an $N$ such that $I_i = I_N$ for all $i>N$. Therefore, the sequence of nested intervals such that $r_n \notin I_n$ cannot be constructured. 

 _Note to myself_: How does the assumption that $\mathbf{R}$ is countable help in the proof of Theorem 1.5.6.? It helps by enabling us to index each real numbers with $n$. With this index in place, we are able to 
 
 1. construct the nested intervals, such that $r_n \notin I_n$ and 
 2. take countable intersection of the nested intervals, 
 
 which are then to show to be empty.

### [Exercise 1.5.3](#toc) 

Use the following outline to supply proofs for the statements in Theorem 1.5.8.

1. Prove if $A_1, \dots, A_m$ are countable sets then $A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_m$ is countable.

2. Explain why induction _cannot_ be used to prove that if each $A_n$ is countable, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$ is countable.

3. Show how arranging $\mathbf{N}$ into the two-dimensional array
  $$\begin{array}{llllll}1 & 3 & 6 & 10 & 15 & \cdots \\ 2 & 5 & 9 & 14 & \cdots & \\ 4 & 8 & 13 & \cdots & & \\ 7 & 12 & \cdots & & & \\ 11 & \cdots & & & & \\ \vdots & & & & & \end{array}$$
  leads to a proof for the infinite case.

  ---

1. Suppose $A_1$ and $A_2$ are countable. Then there exist functions $f: A_1 \rightarrow N$ and $g: A_2 \rightarrow N$, both of which are onto and 1-1. Define $B_{2} = A_{2}\backslash A_{1} = \{x \in A_2: x \notin A_1 \}$. This means $A_1 \cup A_2 = A_1 \cup B_2$. Define function $h: A_1 \cup B_2 \rightarrow N$ as:

$$\begin{equation}
  h(x)=% 
  \begin{cases}
    f(x) &\text{if $x \in A_1$} \\
    g(x) &\text{if $x \in B_2$}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

which are onto and 1-1. We can iteratively do this for $B_{3} \backslash (A_1 \cup A_2)$,... and we are done.

<span style="color:red">Some improvement: I should have started with finite case first. Consider $B_2 = \{b1, \cdots bm \}$. Also given $f: N \rightarrow A_1$. Then define $h: A_1 \cup B_2$ as  $$\begin{equation}
  h(x)=% 
  \begin{cases}
    b_{x} &\text{if $x \leq m$} \\
    f(x-m) &\text{if $x > m$}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$ </span>

<span style="color:red">If $B_2$ is infinite, then there exists $g: N \rightarrow B_2$. Then we can define $h$ by assigning odd numbers to function $f$, and even numbers to function $g$</span> 

<span style="color:red">To generalize to $m$ case, we already know it holds for two cases. Suppose this statement is true for $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots A_{m-1}$. Then $(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots A_{m-1}) \cup A_{m}$ is countable. </span> 



2. Induction is cannot be used for infinite number sets.

3. Each row represents a disjoint countable set. Their union will form the natural numbers. Therefore suppose $\{A_n\}$ are disjoint, then we can arrange them as follows:

$$\begin{array}{llllll}A_1= & a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\ 
A_2= & a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & \cdots & \\ \vdots & & & & & \end{array}$$

which corresponds to 1-1 and onto mapping from $N$ to infinite unions of $A_n$.

If $\{A_n\}$ are not disjoint, iteratively construct $B_2, B_3 , \cdots$. Note that it is important to consider disjoint sets otherwise the sets may not be 1-1.

<span style="color:red"> Big pictures:

1. Use indexation $b_1, \cdots b_m$ when constructing the function $N \rightarrow \text{ some sets}$. In this question, this indexation is used to list down finite case for $B_2$ and infinite case for $A_1$. Besides, as shown in Exercise 1.5.2, indexation can also be used to construct an infinite case, which then can be used to come up with clever nested sets. Indeed, in part (iii) of this exercise, indexation is used to map $N$ to infinite union of $\{A_n\}$
2. Consider both countable and infinite case.
3. It is important to establish disjoint sets to ensure that the resulting function is 1-1. The way to do this is by excluding previous sets.
4. Exploiting the even and odd numbers of natural numbers can provide a neat trick to construct a bijection with $N$. 
5. Induction usually uses the same trick: Assume it works for 2 cases, assume it works for m cases, then m and m+1 will proceed accordingly.
6. Laying out disjoint rows of infinite sets can help with infinite number of sets, something that induction cannot.</span>

1. Show $(a, b) \sim \mathbf{R}$ for any interval $(a, b)$.

2. Show that an unbounded interval like $(a, \infty)=\{x: x>a\}$ has the same cardinality as $\mathbf{R}$ as well.

3. Using open intervals makes it more convenient to produce the required 1-1, onto functions, but it is not really necessary. Show that $[0,1) \sim(0,1)$ by exhibiting a 1-1 onto function between the two sets.

---

1. Note that $(-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ has the same cardinality with $\mathbf{R}$ using function $ \tan x$. The latter is continuous and strictly increasing, $$ \lim_{\pm \pi/2} \tan x = \pm \infty $$ and thus is bijective.

We then need to establish that any open interval $(a,b)$ can be bijectively mapped to $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$. This can be done by linear transformation as follow:

1. Apply the map $x-a$ so the endpoint is shift to the origin. That is, the image interval is $(0,b-a)$.
2. Rescale the interval to unit length by dividing $b-a$. The image interval is $(0,1)$.
3. Scale up the interval by the length $\pi/2 - (-\pi/2)$. The image interval is $(0, \pi)$.
4. Shift the endpoints by $-\pi/2$, The image interval is $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$.

Composing these steps result in the bijective function $g(x) = -\pi/2 + \frac{\pi}{b-a}(x-a)$

<span style="color:red"> How do you actually establish cardinality with R? For N, we know we can index them, or lay them out in grid. For real numbers, one way is to use $\tan x$. Or linear transformation from other sets that we know have the same cardinality as R.</span>

From (1), we know that $f^{-1}(x) = \arctan (x)$ is a bijective function mapping $\mathbb R \mapsto (-\pi/2, \pi/2)$.

$g(x) = \dfrac{x + \pi/2}{\pi}$ is a bijection mapping $(-\pi/2, \pi/2) \mapsto (0,1)$.

$h(x) = 1/x$ is a bijection mapping $(0,1) \mapsto (1, \infty)$.

Take countably infinite sequence $(x_{n})_{n \geq 1}$ of distinct elements between $0$ and $1$. Define $X$ as the set of the elements of this sequence. Let $x_{0} = 0$.

3. For three sets $A, B$, and $C$, show that $A \sim B$ and $B \sim C$ implies $A \sim C$. These three properties are what is meant by saying that $\sim$ is an \emph{equivalence relation}.

---

1. Because $f(x)=x$ is a bijective function mapping $A \mapsto A$.

2. Trivial. 

3. Suppose $A \sim B$ and $B \sim C$, then there is 1-1, onto $f: A \to B$. Similarly, $g: B \to C$. 

Then if $a_1 \neq a_2$, then $f(a_{1}) \neq f(a_{2})$, which means $g(f(a_{1})) \neq g(f(a_{2}))$. Thus $g \circ f$ is 1-1.

By onto property, for all $c$, there is a $b$ such that $g(b)=c$, and there is $a$  such that $f(a) = b$, which means $g(b) = g(f(a)) = c$. This $g \circ f$ is onto.

### [Exercise 1.5.7](#toc) 

Consider the open interval $(0,1)$, and let $S$ be the set of points in the open unit square; that is, $S=\{(x, y): 0<x, y<1\}$.

1. Find a 1-1 function that maps $(0,1)$ into, but not necessarily onto, $S$. (This is easy.)

2. Use the fact that every real number has a decimal expansion to produce a $1-1$ function that maps $S$ into $(0,1)$. Discuss whether the formulated function is onto. (Keep in mind that any terminating decimal expansion such as $.235$ represents the same real number as $.234999 \ldots .$)

---

1. $f(x) =(x, 0.5)$

2. $g(x,y) = \frac{x+y}{2}$ if $x \geq y$ and $\frac{x+y}{3}$ otherwise.

This is wrong because suppose we have $(0.2,0.2) \neq (0.3,0.1)$, but $g$ will map these into the same value. 

<span style=color:red> Answer: Suppose we have $ x  = 0.x_{1}x_{2}\cdots $ and $y = 0.y_{1}y_{2} \cdots $. Then $g(x,y) = 0.x_{1}y_{1}x_{2}y_{2} \cdots$ *(where we use terminating form over repeating 9s)* is 1-1 because given two distinct points $(x,y) \neq (s,t)$, then either $x \neq s$ or $y \neq t$, which means that at least in one decimal place we have $x_{i} \neq s_{i}$ or $y_{i} \neq t_{i}$. This function is not onto. Since the pair $x=0.79999\cdots$ and $y=0.65455\cdots$ are not allowed due to convention of terminating decimals, the point $0.7695949595\cdots$ is not in the range of $g$. Another example is the point $0.1$, which means a pair of $0.1$ and $0$ is needed, the latter is not in the domain $(0,1)$.</span>

<span style=color:red>Not too sure what this second question is trying to get at. My first thought is that given any $x, y$, we can map to $\frac{x+y}{2}$, but this is not unique, because it is equal to $\frac{y+x}{2}$. Or we can assign to $\frac{x+y}{2}$ if $x \geq y$ and $\frac{x+y}{3}$ otherwise (which is wrong due to reasons above). Alternatively, we can assign $f(x,y) = 0.xy$. But this is weird because if $x=0.9, y=0.99$, what does this lead to? (this is almost right, you just have to spell it out)</span>

### [Exercise 1.5.8](#toc) 

  Let $B$ be a set of positive real numbers with the property that adding together any finite subset of elements from $B$ always gives a sum of 2 or less. Show $B$ must be finite or countable.

---

The idea is to decompose $B$ into a countably many finite sets (i.e. the union of which will form $B$). This is made possible due to this condition:

> any finite subset of elements from $B$ always gives a sum of 2 or less.

The proof then is completed by theorem 1.5.8(ii).

There are a number of ways to show this. One way:

Define $B_{0}= \{x \in B \vert x>1  \}$. For each $n \in \mathbb N$, define $B_{n} = (\frac{1}{n+1},\frac{1}{n}]$. Note that each $B_{i}$ is finite because the number of distinct elements in each of them cannot exceed $2(n+1)$, otherwise the sum of the elements would be at least 2. Moreover, $B = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} B_{i}$, is a union of countably many $B_{i}$. Source: [SE](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1724016/countability-of-set-of-positive-reals-with-bounded-sum-for-all-finite-subsets)

Second way:

Define $B_{n}= \{x \in B \vert x \geq \frac{2}{n}  \}$. Each $B_{n}$ is finite because the number of distinct elements cannot exceed $n$, otherwise the sum of the elements would be greater than 2. The proof is completed by noting that $B = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} B_{i}$, is a union of countably many finite $B_{i}$.

<span style= color:red> What does "adding together any finite subset of elements from $B$ always gives a sum of 2 or less" mean? My first thought is that given two finite subsets $(x_{1}, x_{2})$ and $(y_{1}, y_{2})$, the addition of these subsets $(x_{1}+y_{1}, x_{2}+y_{2})$ is 2 or less, which doesn't make sense. The more plausible explanation is given any finite subset of $B$, the summation of its elements is 2 or less. </span>

<span style= color:red> Damn this question must have obvious answer. I can't figure it out sigh. The solution is beautiful too. </span>

<span style = color:red> Old answer: Let $B$ be a set of positive real numbers. Assume that given any finite subset of $B$, its elements add to 2 or less. Assume that $B$ is infinite. We must show that $B$ is countable. From Theorem 1.5.8(ii), it suffices to show that each subset of $B$ is countable. </span>

### [Exercise 1.5.9](#toc) 

  A real number $x \in \mathbf{R}$ is called algebraic if there exist integers $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n} \in \mathbf{Z}$, not all zero, such that
  $$
  a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}=0
  $$
  Said another way, a real number is algebraic if it is the root of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not algebraic are called _transcendental_ numbers. Reread the last paragraph of Section 1.1. The final question posed here is closely related to the question of whether or not transcendental numbers exist.

 1. Show that $\sqrt{2}, \sqrt[3]{2}$, and $\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2}$ are algebraic.
 
 2. Fix $n \in \mathbf{N}$, and let $A_{n}$ be the algebraic numbers obtained as roots of polynomials with integer coefficients that have degree $n$. Using the fact that every polynomial has a finite number of roots, show that $A_{n}$ is countable.
 
 3. Now, argue that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable. What may we conclude about the set of transcendental numbers?
  
  ---

  1. $x^{2} -2=0$; $x^{3} -2 =0$; $x = \sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2} \implies x^{2} = 5 + 2 \sqrt{6} \implies (x^{2}-5)^{2} = 24 \implies x^{4} -10x^{2} + 1 =0$

  2. Each polynomial has a finite number $k$ of roots. Moreover, each polynomial of degree $n$ can be represented by $(n+1)$-tuple of integers. Therefore $ \lvert A_{n} \rvert = k \lvert \mathbb Z^{n+1} \rvert$. But we know that $k \lvert \mathbb Z^{n+1} \rvert =k \lvert \mathbb N^{n+1} \rvert = \lvert \mathbb N^{n+1} \rvert$ as natural numbers can be bijectively mapped into integers. Finally, $\lvert \mathbb N^{n+1} \rvert = \lvert \mathbb N \rvert$ because given arbitrary element of $\lvert \mathbb N^{n+1} \rvert$, (e.g. $(a_{0}, \cdots, a_{n})$), consider its sum plus the length, and call this number as the "class" of the element. The key observation is that for each $k \in \mathbb N$, there are finite number of elements of class $k$. This is because for the element to have class $k$, the length of the element must be $\leq k$, and each member of the element must be $\leq k$. So there are at most $k^k$ elements of class $k$. We can construct an injective mapping to $\mathbb N$. We map each element of class 1 to the lowest natural numbers, then map each element of class 2 to the next lowest natural numbers and so on. (This last argument is obtained from [Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/countable-sets-and-kleene-star)).

  Alternative solution: Given a fixed $n,m \in \mathbb N$, consider the set of polynomials with integers $a_0, a_1, \cdots a_n$ such that that the sum of the absolute values is less than or equal to $m$ (alternatively, we can just take $a_0, a_1, \cdots a_n$ to be natural numbers, since $\mathbb Z$ map bijectively with $\mathbb N$). This set of polynomials of degree $n$ is finite because each integer must have absolute value less than or equal to $m$. 
  
  Let $A_{nm}$ be the set of roots of these polynomials. Since each polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ roots, $\lvert A_{nm} \rvert$ is finite.

  Thus, $A_{n} = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{nm}$ is a union of finite sets, which by Exercise 1.5.3 implies that it is countable.

  Reflection: This question teaches me new proving technique. Namely, when showing that that a n-tuple consisting of elements of a set $S$, is countable, I first must show that the that $S$ is finite. From which we can conclude that for a given $n$, the tuple is finite of order $\lvert S \rvert^{n} $. If $S$ is infinite, we can't do this. What we can, is to look at something else such that we can still map them bijectively with natural number. To do so, we replace $S$ with $N$ (possible since $S$ is countable). Then construct a class $k$ which corresponds to finite set of elements. This class $k$ can be the sum of the member of tuple plus its length. These conditions limit class $k$ size. Thus, there are $k^k$ elements. From here, we can simply list them and map with natural numbers.

Earlier answer draft: 

  Every polynominal has a finite number of roots 

  $\implies$ There are countable polynomials with degree $n$

  $$\begin{array}{llllll}A_1= & a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\ 
A_2= & a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & \cdots & \\ \vdots & & & & & \end{array}$$

First we show that there are countably many polynomials with degree. Given $n$, and integer $a_{ij}$ the following is the list of all possible polynomials of degree $n$:

 $$\begin{array}{llllll}\alpha_1= & a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ 
A_2= & a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & \cdots & \\ \vdots & & & & & \end{array}$$

</span>

3. As $A_n$ is countable, the infinite union of $A_n$, i.e. the set of algebraic numbers, is also countable by Exercise 1.5.3. 

Let $A$ be the set of algebraic numbers, and $T$ be the set of transcedental numbers. Clearly, $A \cup T = \mathbb R$. Thus $T$ cannot be countable, since otherwise it implies $R$ is countable.

### [Exercise 1.5.10](#toc) 

1. Let $C \subseteq[0,1]$ be uncountable. Show that there exists $a \in(0,1)$ such that $C \cap[a, 1]$ is uncountable.
2. Now let $A$ be the set of all $a \in(0,1)$ such that $C \cap[a, 1]$ is uncountable, and set $\alpha=\sup A$. Is $C \cap[\alpha, 1]$ an uncountable set?
3. Does the statement in (a) remain true if "uncountable" is replaced by "infinite"?

---

1. Suppose by contradiction $\forall a \in (0,1), C \cap [a,1]$ is countable. It follows that $$ \bigcup_{n \geq 1} C \cap [\frac{1}{n},1]$$ is countable by Exercise 1.5.3. But this is equal to $C \cap [0,1]$, which is uncountable.

<span style=color:green>
Damn I fucked up this question. Took me so long to figure out. Anyhow, a lesson here is to look for a special case that I can generalize to the question. In this case, using  

$\frac{1}{n}$.

</span> 

<span style=color:red> 
Earlier draft:

$C$ is uncountable $\implies$ it is not bijectively mapped with $\mathbb N$

$C \subseteq [0,1] \implies C = [a,b]$ or $(a,b)$ for $a,b \in [0,1]$.

Suppose for all $a \in (0,1)$, $C \cap [a,1] = K $ is countable. Thus, there exist a bijective map $f: \mathbb N \to K$. Suppose $C$ is a closed interval. Then $K$ is a closed interval. And we know from exercise 1.5.4 that a closed interval is uncountable. Similarly, if $K$ is not a closed interval, then we know that is uncountable.

</span>

2. Suppose $C \cap [\alpha,1]$ is uncountable. . Given any arbitrary $\frac{1}{n} >0$, $C \cap [\alpha + \frac{1}{n}, 1]$ is countable. Which means $ \bigcup_{n \geq 1} C \cap [\alpha + \frac{1}{n}, 1]$ is countable by Exercise 1.5.3. But this is equal to $C \cap [\alpha,1]$, which is uncountable. This is a contradiction.

3. No. Take the sequence $1 = x_{1} > x_{2} > \cdots > 0$. For example, consider the sequence  $x_{n} = (\frac{1}{n})$. Let $X$ be the set of this sequence, and thus $X \subseteq [0,1]$ and it is infinite. It follows that $X \cap [a,1]$ is finite. This is because the intersection is equal to $\{x_{n0}, x_{n0-1}, \cdots, x_{1} = 1\}$ where $x_{n0} \geq a$.

### [Exercise 1.5.11](#toc) 

Schr√∂der-Bernstein Theorem:
  Assume there exists a 1-1 function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ and another 1-1 function $g: Y \rightarrow X .$ Follow the steps to show that there exists a 1-1, onto function $h: X \rightarrow Y$ and hence $X \sim Y$.
  The strategy is to partition $X$ and $Y$ into components
  $$
  X=A \cup A^{\prime} \quad \text { and } \quad Y=B \cup B^{\prime}
  $$
  with $A \cap A^{\prime}=\emptyset$ and $B \cap B^{\prime}=\emptyset$, in such a way that $f$ maps $A$ onto $B$, and $g$ maps $B^{\prime}$ onto $A^{\prime}$.

  1. Explain how achieving this would lead to a proof that $X \sim Y$.

  2. Set $A_{1}=X \setminus g(Y)=\{x \in X: x \notin g(Y)\}$ (what happens if $\left.A_{1}=\emptyset ?\right)$ and inductively define a sequence of sets by letting $A_{n+1}=g\left(f\left(A_{n}\right)\right)$. Show that $\left\{A_{n}: n \in \mathbf{N}\right\}$ is a pairwise disjoint collection of subsets of $X$, while $\left\{f\left(A_{n}\right): n \in \mathbf{N}\right\}$ is a similar collection in $Y$.
  
  3. Let $A=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{n}$ and $B=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} f\left(A_{n}\right)$. Show that $f$ maps $A$ onto $B$.
  
  4. Let $A^{\prime}=X \setminus A$ and $B^{\prime}=Y \setminus B$. Show $g$ maps $B^{\prime}$ onto $A^{\prime}$.
